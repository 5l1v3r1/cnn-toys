Convolutional neural networks are fairly simple, and it's easy to apply them. However, it's also easy to lose track of which architectures work well for different applications.

I want to use this repo to play with different applications of CNNs. That way, I gain some intuition for when to use transposed convolutions, upsampling, residual connections, leaky ReLUs, etc.
